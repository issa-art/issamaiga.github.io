      <h3>Introduction To Web Design</h3>
      <p>
        For this week of lifelong learning, I continued to learn more about web
        development, and my focus is JavaScript. Based on my experience, HTML
        and CSS is easy to follow and implement. However, when I started
        learning JS, I realized that it helps in adding functionalities to the
        Web or mobile application. My first JS code is to write a program that
        will be able to turn on/off a light bulb once the related button is
        clicked using getElementByID. From this, I was able to know how useful
        JS functions can change the functionality of a website or phone
        application. Unfortunately, the button appears on the web page, but the
        image of the light bulb could not display. I tried to fix all the
        possible bugs I noticed, but it did not work. From this, I was able to
        understand some of the codes I will be running in the future might not
        work as expected. My interaction with Visual Studio is getting stronger
        daily, and I am discovering new tools and functions. One thing I like
        about Visual Studio is, that it allows users to use different work
        frames when writing their programs. As a result, I found it easy to use
        and implement my codes without facing many problems. In addition, it
        also suggests different functions once I started writing codes. I
        believe learning JS will not only help me to add functionality to
        website, but also help me to build a new skill set in mobile app
        development as a programming language.

      <h3>Free Web Templates</h3>
      <p>
        For this week of lifelong learning, I explore the different websites to
        download a whole web template, which can help me to change code, add new
        programs and also test my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was
        amazed that there are different websites offering these services, and
        they also have different types of templates. One thing I like about
        these platforms is that they have no restrictions when adding codes and
        programs. All the files necessary to help you customize our web page are
        available, which makes the customization process perfectly easy. Also,
        the navigation through the website is easy and user-friendly. In order
        to customize the website, I used a text editor called Visual Studio,
        which I have been using to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This made
        it easier for me. I was able to identify different parameters within the
        header, and body, which are composed of other segments like the
        paragraphs. Moreover, I also understood how CSS and JavaScript programs
        are embedded in websites. I believe this experience will help me develop
        my skills in various prospects of website designing, such as customizing
        and managing websites.

      <h3>Free Web Hosting</h3>
      <p>
        For this week of lifelong learning, I explore three different websites
        that offer free web hosting services, namely: GitHub, and 000webhost.
        Initially, I thought it will be very difficult to upload a website to
        these platforms. However, I found it very easy to upload a website to
        these platforms. Although, there are different platforms that offer web
        hosting services and I think most of them are free. However, there are
        few popular ones that offer incredible free hosting services such as
        GitHub, and 000webhost. For this weekâ€™s practice, I decided to focus on
        GitHub. In order to upload a website on GitHub, I had to create a user
        account which requires filling in some basic information for
        accessibility, which enable me to have access to all available resources
        the platform offers. I believe this platform will help me to test and
        see what my front-end web page looks like as I am practicing to improve
        my web designing skills.
